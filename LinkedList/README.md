# Linked Lists
A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list.
It's like a chain of connected blocks, where each block holds some information and points to the next block.


Imagine a train with multiple cars, where each car has a cargo and is connected to the next car.
In a linked list, you can easily add or remove nodes by changing the references between them.
This allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to other data structures like arrays.

However, accessing a specific node in a linked list requires traversing through the list from the beginning.

Linked lists are commonly used in various applications, such as implementing stacks, queues, and graphs.

They provide flexibility and dynamic memory allocation, making them suitable for scenarios where the size of the data can change dynamically.
