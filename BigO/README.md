Big-O Notation is a clear way of describing the complexity of your code using algebraic terms.

Big O specifically looks at the worst-case scenario of an algorithm â€“ looking at the big picture.
It tells us how long a function will take to execute (execution time) or how much space (e.g., in memory or disk) the function takes up as the input to that function approaches infinity (i.e. becomes very large).

## BigO notation examples (From best to worst)
1. Constant time O(1)
2. Logarithmic time O(log n)
3. Linear time O(n)
4. Quadratic time O(n^2)
5. Exponential time O(2^n)

## Time Complexity:
analyzing how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the input increases.

## Space Complexity:
(aka auxiliary space complexity) The space required by the algorithm, not including inputs.
